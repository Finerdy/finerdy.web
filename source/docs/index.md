# Introduction to Finerdy

Finerdy is a personal accounting app designed for people who manage multiple currencies. If you get paid in dollars, save in euros, and spend in pesos, you know how hard it is to have a clear view of your finances. Finerdy solves that problem.

## The problem

When your finances are spread across multiple currencies, difficult questions arise:

- How much did I earn this month in total?
- How much did I really spend?
- What's my net worth?

Traditional apps aren't built for this. They force you to choose a single currency or do automatic conversions with rates that don't reflect your reality.

## The solution

Finerdy lets you:

1. **Keep each account in its native currency** - Your US account stays in dollars, your European one in euros.
2. **Define a reference currency** - Choose which currency you want to see your consolidated reports in.
3. **Record real conversions** - When you exchange currency, record the actual rate you got.
4. **See unified reports** - All your numbers converted to your reference currency.

## Key concepts

To use Finerdy effectively, you need to understand some concepts:

- **[Accounts](/en/docs/concepts/#accounts)** - Represent your bank accounts, wallets, or cash.
- **[Categories](/en/docs/concepts/#categories)** - Organize your transactions by type (Groceries, Salary, etc).
- **[Reference currency](/en/docs/concepts/#reference-currency)** - The currency in which you see all your reports.
- **[Transactions](/en/docs/transactions/)** - Money movements (income, expenses, transfers, exchanges).
- **[Budgets](/en/docs/budgets/)** - Spending limits by category.
- **[Workspaces](/en/docs/workspaces/)** - Separate spaces for different contexts (personal, family, business).

## Getting started

1. **Create your workspace** - When you register, your first workspace is created automatically.
2. **Set your reference currency** - Choose the currency in which you want to see your reports.
3. **Add your accounts** - Create an account for each bank account, wallet, or cash you have.
4. **Create your categories** - Define the categories you use to classify your expenses and income.
5. **Start recording** - Every time money comes in or goes out, record it.
